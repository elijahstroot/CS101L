## PROBLEM : We are defining functions to create a slot gambling machine. This machine must calculate how much money is won, based on what is wagered
##      
## ALGORITHM : 
## 1. Create a program that continues to loop until the user does not want to play anymore. 
2. Use a definition to create that loop
3. ask the user what they would like to wager. It must be greater then zero and less then what they have in their bank. 
3. Create three random numbers for the slots that are between 0 and 10. 
4. If all three of the random slots match, then the user wins 10 times how much they wagered. 
5. If two of the three random slots match, then the user wins three times how much they wagered. 
6. Otherwise, the user loses
7. Show how much is left in their bank after winning or losing. 
8. Once their bank is equal to 0, they must choose to invest more and play again.
